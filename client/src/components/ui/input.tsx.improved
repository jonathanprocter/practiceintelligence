### Improvements Made:
1. **Type Safety and Best Practices:**
   - Imported `ForwardedRef` and `InputHTMLAttributes` from React to ensure type safety.
   - Defined `InputProps` interface extending `InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>` for clearer prop typing.

2. **Performance and Memory Efficiency:**
   - The changes in typing and the use of utility functions like `cn` do not directly impact performance but ensure better maintainability and potential for optimization in larger projects.

3. **Readability and Maintainability:**
   - Added a utility function `cn` directly in the file for class concatenation to avoid unnecessary imports and to make the code self-contained and easier to understand.
   - Added JSDoc comments for better documentation and understanding of the component's purpose and usage.

4. **Modern ES6+ Features and Patterns:**
   - Utilized template literals and arrow functions for a cleaner and more modern syntax.

5. **Proper Error Handling:**
   - Since this is a UI component, specific error handling within the component is not applicable. However, ensuring type safety and proper prop typing helps prevent runtime errors.

6. **Security Considerations:**
   - For UI components like `Input`, security considerations mainly involve ensuring that the component does not directly handle sensitive data without proper sanitization. This code does not directly address security concerns but follows best practices by not including any direct data processing or storage logic.

7. **Better Documentation with JSDoc:**
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to improve documentation, making it easier for developers to understand the component's purpose and how to use it.
