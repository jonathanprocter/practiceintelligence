- **TypeScript Best Practices and Type Safety**: Introduced `ToastProps` interface for better type safety and clarity on the props structure.
- **Performance and Memory Efficiency**: Directly returned JSX elements inside `map` without an intermediate return statement, which is a minor optimization but keeps the code clean.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Used arrow function for concise syntax and improved readability. Also, destructured props directly in the map function parameter for clarity.
- **Modern ES6+ Features and Patterns**: Utilized arrow functions and destructuring assignment, which are part of ES6+.
- **Proper Error Handling**: Not directly applicable in this context as the component mainly renders UI based on props. Error handling should be implemented in the `useToast` hook or wherever the toasts state is managed.
- **Security Considerations**: Since this component is primarily for rendering UI based on provided props, the main security consideration would be ensuring that any dynamic content rendered (e.g., `title`, `description`) is properly sanitized before being passed to this component to prevent XSS attacks. This is more about how the props are generated rather than the component itself.
- **Better Documentation with JSDoc**: Added a JSDoc comment for the `Toaster` component to explain its purpose and usage.
