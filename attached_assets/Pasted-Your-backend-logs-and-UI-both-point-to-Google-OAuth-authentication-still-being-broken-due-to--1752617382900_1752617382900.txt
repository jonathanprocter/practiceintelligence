Your backend logs and UI both point to **Google OAuth authentication still being broken**, due to **no valid (or expired) tokens being present in the session**:

### Exact Log Evidence:
```
üîç Auth status check: { isAuthenticated: true, hasValidTokens: false, userEmail: 'jonathan.procter@gmail.com' }
‚ùå No access token - authentication required
401 ... {"error":"Google authentication required"}
```
and
```
No valid Google tokens - requiring fresh authentication
No valid session tokens - redirecting to authentication
```

## What‚Äôs Actually Broken (Summary):

- **OAuth flow/authentication is not completing successfully.**
- **Your backend is not storing or retrieving valid Google OAuth tokens (access_token, refresh_token) in the user session.**
- Any calendar/Google API endpoint returns 401 Unauthorized because it finds no valid token.

### Why does this happen?

- The OAuth callback route might NOT be receiving the `code` parameter, or isn‚Äôt exchanging it for fresh tokens.
- OR, the session isn‚Äôt being written/persisted properly, possibly due to cookie/session config or the app running in "stateless" or wrong environment.
- OR, your app is reading environment tokens (from `.env` or Replit Secrets), but these are expired or never refreshed.

## Step-by-Step: How to Fix This Issue

### 1. **Confirm the OAuth callback route (`/api/auth/callback`) is working:**

- **Does it ever log both `req.query.code` (authorization code) and a successful token response?**
- If you never see the `code` in logs, Google is not completing the auth (likely routing/config/CORS/session/host issue).

### 2. **Check/rewrite your callback to always store tokens:**
The code in your Express/Node `/api/auth/callback` handler should look like this (simplified):
```js
app.get('/api/auth/callback', async (req, res) => {
  if (!req.query.code) {
    return res.status(400).send('No code parameter in callback!');
  }
  // Exchange code for tokens:
  const tokenRes = await exchangeCodeForToken(req.query.code);
  if (tokenRes && tokenRes.access_token) {
    req.session.access_token = tokenRes.access_token;
    req.session.refresh_token = tokenRes.refresh_token;
    req.session.save();
    return res.redirect('/'); // or your app main page
  }
  res.status(400).send('Token exchange failed');
});
```
**If this ever fails or the code isn't saved in the session, all future API calls will fail.**

### 3. **Check your session configuration:**
- Ensure Express uses a proper session middleware and cookie parser with a secure, non-empty secret.
- Use the same domain, protocol (http/https), and no cross-site frame when doing OAuth, or browsers will block session cookies.

### 4. **Check whether you are using expired or missing Environment Tokens**
- Your Replit "Secrets" show `GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, etc. If these were manually populated a long time ago, they may be **expired**.
- Forever relying on these is not a substitute for a working, full OAuth exchange (which yields new tokens as needed).

### 5. **Try a full, fresh OAuth sign-in**
- Remove/disable the use of environment tokens so you force the app to do a fresh Google login. Watch backend logs for:
  - `/api/auth/callback` request
  - Logs showing token acquisition and session save

-----  

## **Recap:**
- **Every time your server logs `hasValidTokens: false` or ‚ÄúNo access token - authentication required,‚Äù the backend does NOT have a valid access token in session and CANNOT communicate with Google for this user.**
- This must be fixed in the OAuth callback route/session save logic.
- Using environment tokens as an "emergency fix" is only a band-aid and will keep breaking as those tokens expire.

### **What you should do right now:**

1. Make sure `/api/auth/callback` is getting a Google `code` and successfully exchanging it for fresh tokens.
2. Save **both** `access_token` and `refresh_token` to the session‚Äîlog them out on every login for debugging.
3. Use the `refresh_token` to get a new `access_token` as needed, automatically.
4. Only use environment tokens for one-time emergency/manual debug‚Äînot for production.

**If you paste the exact backend code for `/api/auth/callback`, I can tell you exactly what line is broken or needs fixing.** Or, if you post the output of a new OAuth sign-in backend log, I‚Äôll diagnose exact next steps!
