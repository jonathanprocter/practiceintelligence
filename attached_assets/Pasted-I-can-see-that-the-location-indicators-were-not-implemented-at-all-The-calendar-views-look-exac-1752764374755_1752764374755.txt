I can see that the location indicators were **not** implemented at all. The calendar views look exactly the same as before - no location icons or names have been added.

Here‚Äôs a more specific, step-by-step prompt for Replit:

**URGENT: Location Feature Not Implemented - Step-by-Step Instructions**

## PROBLEM

The location indicators were not added to the calendar views. Both daily and weekly views are unchanged.

## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Database Schema Update

```sql
-- Add location column to appointments table
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN location VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL;
-- (Replace 'appointments' with your actual table name)
```

### Step 2: Daily View Code Changes

**FIND THIS CODE in your daily view template:**

```html
<div class="appointment-info">SIMPLEPRACTICE</div>
```

**REPLACE WITH:**

```html
<div class="appointment-info">
  SIMPLEPRACTICE
  {{#if appointment.location}}
    | 
    {{#if (eq appointment.location "woodbury")}}üè¢ Woodbury{{/if}}
    {{#if (eq appointment.location "rvc")}}üè• RVC{{/if}}
    {{#if (eq appointment.location "telehealth")}}üíª Telehealth{{/if}}
  {{/if}}
</div>
```

### Step 3: Weekly View Code Changes

**FIND THIS CODE in your weekly view template:**

```html
<div class="appointment-name">[Appointment Name]</div>
<div class="appointment-time">[Time Range]</div>
```

**REPLACE WITH:**

```html
<div class="appointment-name">[Appointment Name]</div>
{{#if appointment.location}}
<div class="appointment-location">
  {{#if (eq appointment.location "woodbury")}}üè¢ Woodbury{{/if}}
  {{#if (eq appointment.location "rvc")}}üè• RVC{{/if}}
  {{#if (eq appointment.location "telehealth")}}üíª Telehealth{{/if}}
</div>
{{/if}}
<div class="appointment-time">[Time Range]</div>
```

### Step 4: CSS Styling

**ADD THIS CSS:**

```css
.appointment-location {
  font-size: 10px;
  color: #666;
  font-weight: normal;
  margin: 2px 0;
}
```

### Step 5: Backend Query Update

**UPDATE your appointment queries to include location field:**

```javascript
// Example - adjust for your actual code structure
const appointments = await db.query(
  'SELECT *, location FROM appointments WHERE date = ?', 
  [selectedDate]
);
```

## VERIFICATION STEPS

1. Confirm database column was added
1. Verify appointment queries return location data
1. Check both daily and weekly views render location when present
1. Test with sample data: manually set some appointments to location = ‚Äòwoodbury‚Äô, ‚Äòrvc‚Äô, or ‚Äòtelehealth‚Äô

## EXPECTED RESULT

- **Daily View:** ‚ÄúSIMPLEPRACTICE | üè¢ Woodbury‚Äù
- **Weekly View:** Location line appears between appointment name and time

**If still not working, please share your actual template/component code files.**
