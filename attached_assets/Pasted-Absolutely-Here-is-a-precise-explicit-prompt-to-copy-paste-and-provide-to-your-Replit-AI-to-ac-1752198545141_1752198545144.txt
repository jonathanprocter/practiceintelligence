Absolutely. Here is a **precise, explicit prompt to copy-paste and provide to your Replit AI** to achieve the exact changes you want for your “pixel-perfect” daily planner PDF export:

## VERBATIM INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AI

**1. Header Adjustments**
- Make the header smaller and visually balanced; do NOT let it dominate the top of the export.
- Date and “appointments today” summary should be in a single horizontal row just beneath the title, aligning left with the calendar table.
- The "Weekly" button should appear clearly above or to the left of the header, looking like the real dashboard button (distinct, outlined, properly labeled "Back to week" or "Weekly Overview").

**2. Event Rendering & Sizing**
- All appointment events MUST appear *inside* the appointment grid/cell, not floating outside or overlapping the table lines.
- Increase the font size for the event summary (name, time, and source) so the appointment content visually fills and “owns” the appointment slot/row.
- Do NOT crowd events, but maximize their use of vertical and horizontal space within cells—padding should be minimal.
- The appointment rows should expand vertically if event title/time requires.

**3. Remove Empty Notes/Actions**
- “Event Notes” and “Action Items” **must only display** if they have actual note/action content for that appointment.
- If there are no notes or actions for an event (e.g., Sherrifa Hoosein), do NOT render empty “Event Notes”/“Action Items” headers/fields—omit them completely for that row.

**4. Timeline Divider**
- Add a **vertical dividing line** (solid, #222 or matching dashboard), just like the WEEKLY view, between the left time column and the event cell area.
- This vertical line should extend the full visible table height and be visually identical to the weekly and dashboard views (not too thick or faint).

**5. Calendar Legend**
- The legend (SimplePractice, Google Calendar, Holidays in United States) should appear right under the header, styled as aligned badges or a colored bar (like the dashboard), **not** as a bulleted list or out-of-place text.
- Use the actual dashboard colors and icons for each legend entry (SimplePractice = blue, Google Calendar = green, Holidays = yellow/orange).

**6. General Layout**
- The appointment grid/table must have clear, straight lines—do NOT allow event text to bleed outside of boxes.
- All times should appear in the left column, right-aligned and vertically centered, with clear separation from the main event cell.
- Ensure all boundaries, column widths, and font weights match the live dashboard and weekly export exactly.

**7. Responsive Sizing & Spacing**
- Appointment font and box should scale to use available grid space, filling the cell more completely, but do NOT allow text to overflow or overlap cell lines.

**8. Margins, Spacing, and Print**
- Margins between “header/summary/legend” and the table/grid should be minimal and consistent with the live UI.
- Maintain correct portrait orientation for daily view export.

**9. PDF Export Checklist**
- After export, verify:
    - The header is compact and styled like the dashboard
    - All appointments are inside their boxes, are bolder/larger, and there is no “Event Notes/Action Items” unless populated
    - The vertical time divider matches weekly/dashboard style
    - The legend looks right and is just below the header
    - All alignment, font, and cell lines match the on-screen daily dashboard

**NOTE:**  
If possible, render and compare a side-by-side image of the daily dashboard and daily PDF export to confirm complete visual fidelity before considering the change “done”.

Copy and paste the above **exactly** into your Replit AI or development agent. If you have a place to upload a screenshot or include a PDF example, do so and reference it as the “ground truth”.
