📱 SAMPLE DAILY VIEW EXAMPLE
I've created a sample daily export showing exactly what the enhanced three-column daily view looks like for Monday, July 21, 2025. This demonstrates:
✅ Three-Column Layout Examples:
Sarah Johnson Session: Full 3-column layout (details + notes + actions)
Team Meeting: 2-column layout (details + actions only)
Michael Chen Therapy: 2-column layout (details + notes only)
Lunch Break: 1-column layout (details only, no notes/actions)
✅ Smart Conditional Display:
Columns only appear when there's actual content
No empty vertical lines for appointments without notes/actions
Professional, clean appearance
✅ Perfect App Replication:
Matches your current daily view styling exactly
SimplePractice blue borders with thick left edges
Proper navigation buttons and statistics
Clean, modern design
