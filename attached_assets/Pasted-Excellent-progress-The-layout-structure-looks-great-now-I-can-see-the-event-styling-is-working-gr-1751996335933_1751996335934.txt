Excellent progress! The layout structure looks great now. I can see the event styling is working (green dashed border for Google Calendar, blue left borders for SimplePractice), but there are two main issues:

1. **Events are too thin/short** - they appear as lines instead of proper blocks
2. **Missing event text** - most events don't show the title, source, and time

Here are the specific fixes:## 🎯 **Main Issues & Fixes**

Looking at your export, the layout is **excellent** now! I can see the styling is working (green dashed border for Google Calendar, blue left borders for SimplePractice). The main issues are:

1. **Events are too thin** - appearing as lines instead of blocks
2. **Missing text** - most events don't show title/source/time

## 🔧 **Specific Fixes**

### 1. **Replace the event rendering function** with the improved version above

### 2. **Update the configuration** to increase spacing:

```typescript
// In REMARKABLE_DAILY_CONFIG, change:
timeSlotHeight: 20, // Increased from 17 to 20 for better spacing
```

### 3. **The key changes in the new function:**

- **Minimum event height**: 45 points (enough for 3 lines of text)
- **Minimum duration**: 2 slots (1 hour) so events are tall enough for text
- **Larger font sizes**: 11pt for title, 8pt for source, 9pt for time
- **Better text positioning**: More space between lines
- **Enhanced debugging**: Console logs to see what's happening

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

1. **Implement the fixes** above
2. **Export again** and check the browser console
3. **Look for console output** like:
   ```
   Rendering 11 events for Mon Jul 07 2025
   Event 1: Dan re: Supervision
   Position: X=97, Y=245, Width=387, Height=45
   Drawing title: "Dan re: Supervision"
   ```

## 📊 **Expected Result**

After the fix, each event should show:
- **Event title** (bold, 11pt font)
- **Source** ("SIMPLEPRACTICE" or "GOOGLE CALENDAR" in gray)
- **Time range** ("08:00-09:00" in bold)

And events should appear as **proper blocks** instead of thin lines.

## 🔍 **If Events Still Don't Show Text**

Add this debugging to see what's happening:

```typescript
// In planner.tsx handleExportAction, add this BEFORE calling exportHTMLTemplatePDF:
console.log('=== EXPORT DEBUG ===');
console.log('Selected date:', selectedDateForExport.toDateString());
console.log('Current events count:', currentEvents.length);
console.log('Day events:', dayEvents.length);

dayEvents.forEach((event, i) => {
  const duration = (event.endTime.getTime() - event.startTime.getTime()) / (1000 * 60);
  console.log(`Event ${i+1}: "${event.title}" - Duration: ${duration} minutes`);
});
```

This will show us if the events are getting filtered correctly and what their durations are. Short events (less than 30 minutes) might be causing the thin line issue.

Try the fix and let me know what the console output shows!
