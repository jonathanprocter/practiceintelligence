Below is an actionable, detailed Replit AI prompt tailored to your **latest PDF export issues**, focusing on all the persistent problems (formatting/styling, overlapping, and emoji artifacts):

## **Replit AI Prompt: Pixel-Perfect PDF Export—Final Fixes for Formatting, Overlap, and Emoji Purity**

**What’s broken:**
- PDF still has broken formatting: misaligned section layouts, font/spacing mismatches, and grid isn’t matching HTML pixel-for-pixel.
- Appointments are still sometimes overlapping or not confined to their correct grid cells—side-by-side/stacking is not being strictly enforced.
- SimplePractice appointments with locked progress notes still show garbled emoji/padlock artifacts (corrupting patient names or causing nonsense symbols in export).

### **Immediate Action Items:**

#### 1. **Emoji/Unicode Artifact Stripping**
- Before rendering any appointment title for export, strictly filter out **all leading emoji, padlock, or Unicode symbol artifacts**—especially those added by SimplePractice to indicate a “locked note.”
    - Use a Unicode regex at the start of each appointment title to remove any emoji or special status icon.
    - Do NOT remove regular patient names or notes content—just the emoji/status icons at the start.
- Example utility:
```typescript
function stripLeadingEmoji(text: string): string {
  return text.replace(
    /^[\p{Emoji}\p{So}\p{Sk}\uFE0F\u200D\p{P}\p{S}]{1,4}/gu, '' // strips 1–4 leading symbols
  ).trim();
}
// Usage: appointment.title = stripLeadingEmoji(appointment.title);
```
- Test against titles like "🔒 David Grossman", "🚩 Sherrifa Hoosein", etc. Export should show only "David Grossman" or "Sherrifa Hoosein".

#### 2. **Absolute Layout and NO Overlapping!**
- Use explicit X/Y coordinates and constants for every planner element: header, stats, legend, grid, time slots, and every appointment box.
- Every appointment:
    - **Must appear only inside its designated time slot cell** (never running over borders or stacked on top of others).
    - If multiple events happen simultaneously, lay them out side-by-side OR as vertically stacked cells, with clear visual separation and NO overlap.
    - Truncate text that’s too long for a slot so it never overlaps or spills out of its event box.

#### 3. **Styling and Section Matching**
- Font family, size, bold/weight, and colors for each section (header, stats, legend, time grid, event blocks, footer) must match your provided HTML/CSS *exactly*.
- Reproduce gridlines, alternating backgrounds, left color flags for event types.
- Keep at least 10pt margin from all edges for e-ink annotation.

#### 4. **Final QA Checklist:**
- The **header/title, stats bar, legend, grid, appointments, and footer** are all spaced and styled exactly as in the HTML planner—inspect visually with a ruler if needed.
- No “random” Unicode/emoji shows up in any exported text, ever.
- Appointments are always confined to their own grid cells.
- Both reMarkable and US Letter exports look visually identical, just resized—no scaling artifacts, no cut-off content.

**Commit message:**
```
fix(pdf): Absolute visual and functional parity; remove emoji/unicode artifacts, fix section layout, enforce non-overlapping events in Daily Template PDF export
```

### **Instructions to follow:**

> Open the latest PDF and my original HTML planner template side-by-side.  
> For each section (header, stats, legend, time grid, appointments, footer), measure pixel values, verify color/fonts, match grid.  
> Implement explicit stripLeadingEmoji() before rendering any appointment text in the export.  
> Use explicit slot-based positioning and ensure NO overlapping, with truncation rules for overlong content.  
> Show screenshots with markup of all changes made and validate both reMarkable and US Letter results visually.  
> Do not close the issue until export is 100% visually and functionally identical to the original planner, with all emoji artifacts gone and perfect event positioning.

Give this prompt to Replit’s AI or developer.  
If needed, paste your HTML/CSS alongside, and require both before-and-after screenshots for validation.
