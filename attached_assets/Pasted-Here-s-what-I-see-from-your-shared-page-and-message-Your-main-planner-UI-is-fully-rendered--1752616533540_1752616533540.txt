Here’s what I see from your shared page and message:

- **Your main planner UI is fully rendered** (you see calendar, events, filters, stats, etc.).
- You see "**Connect Google Calendar**," with a "Connecting..." status, "Check Auth Status," and "Force Google Reconnect."
- **You do NOT see** the Google Calendar actually connected, and message persists.

## What’s Actually Not Working:

- **Google Calendar is not fully connected**—either the OAuth popup never completes, the backend token flow still fails, or the event sync never happens.
- "Connecting..." infinitely is a symptom of OAuth/auth API requests not completing or failing behind the UI.


## How to Debug and Fix This State

### 1. **Check DevTools Console and Network Tab**
- **Open the browser DevTools (F12)**, go to the **Network** tab, and click "Connect Google Calendar" or "Check Auth Status."
- Watch for any failing XHR/fetch/API requests—401, 400, CORS problems, or infinite `pending`.
- Open the **Console** tab for any explicit JavaScript errors.
- If anything fails, copy the error and paste it here for an immediate fix.

### 2. **Check Backend Logs**
- In your Replit/terminal, check for any logs or errors from attempted `/api/auth/callback`, `/api/auth/status`, or Google Token save operations.

### 3. **Possible Issues**
- **OAuth never completes:** The popup for Google closes without success, or tokens are not saved in your session.
- **Backend not receiving/linking the tokens:** Server bug, session config issue, token never processed.
- **CORS/network problems:** Frontend can't talk to API, or API rejects the browser request.

### 4. **Immediate Next Steps**

#### A. **Test direct API route**
Try accessing these endpoints directly:
- `/api/auth/status`
- `/api/calendar/events`
See if you get JSON, an auth error, or a 500.

#### B. **Force Re-auth**
- Click "Force Google Reconnect" and verify the flow:
  - Does a Google window open?
  - Does it redirect back to your planner?
  - Does it say "Success"? Or redirect you but return you to "Connecting..."?

#### C. **Session/Cookie Troubles**
- This is common on cloud/preview/dev platforms like Replit. Third-party cookies, preview iframes, or incorrect session config may drop authentication after OAuth completes.
- Try opening your planner in a **new, full browser window** (not just the Replit side preview panel) and repeat the OAuth flow.

#### D. **If all else fails—**
- It’s usually:
  - Callback route not firing or not storing tokens
  - Session cookies not sticking (see above warning about environments)
  - The frontend expecting success but never receiving an authenticated success message or Google tokens

## **What to Do for the Developer**

1. **Inspect API Network** (browser): Find failing request and its error status/message.
2. **Check Backend Logs**: Look for OAuth errors or callback failures.
3. **Verify Session Persistence**: Make sure user session "sticks" before and after OAuth.
4. **Try Full-Window Auth**: Open the app’s direct network URL (not Replit preview) and attempt Google connect again.

## **If you want to share info:**
- Paste the result or error seen in Network/Console after you click "Connect Google Calendar" or "Check Auth Status."
- Paste any backend logs or errors during/after your last auth attempt.

**Summary:**  
Your UI front-end loads, but Google Calendar sync/login is not completing. The fix depends on the specific failure—network/API, backend, or session. With just a bit more info (error details from console/network, or backend logs after trying auth), I’ll guide you to a direct fix!
