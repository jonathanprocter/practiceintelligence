Here‚Äôs how you should address the ‚Äúemoji artifact‚Äù (progress note lock emoji from SimplePractice appointments) and guide Replit AI for a truly professional PDF export:

## **Explicit Prompt for Replit AI:**

**Summary:**  
My latest Daily Template PDF export is *nearly* correct‚Äîbut it still has a formatting/logical bug where some SimplePractice appointments show an emoji or icon at the beginning of the title when a progress note is locked. This causes visible artifacts and breaks the professional look of the PDF. I want all such emojis, icons, or non-text artifacts filtered/stripped from appointment labels **before rendering them to the PDF**.

### **Detailed Instructions:**

**1. Filter out Emojis/Icons in Appointment Titles**
- Before drawing an appointment‚Äôs text, check and remove any leading (or embedded) emoji, lock icons, or other non-ASCII/Unicode symbol artifacts.
- Specifically:
    - SimplePractice *locked* appointments sometimes prepend a lock emoji, padlock Unicode, or other icon as the **first** character of the appointment title (or in a separate field).
    - These are **UI artifacts** only for the web and should NOT appear in the PDF export‚Äîthey break the visual style!
    - Use a Unicode regex to strip any emoji or non-letter character at the beginning of appointment titles.
    - If you see a lock (üîí), padlock, star, checkmark, etc., remove it from the text being rendered.
- If your code renders title like `"üîí John Doe ‚Äî Session"`, your export should show *just* `"John Doe ‚Äî Session"`.

**2. Maintain All Other Title Content**
- Only remove leading or ‚Äústatus‚Äù emojis. Do **not** delete user-entered letters, patient initials, or session type codes that are part of the actual title.
- If multiple emojis/icons are present at the start, remove all of them.

**3. Where To Apply the Filter**
- Place this filtering logic in your PDF export appointment label render function, right before drawing/wrapping text in the appointment cell/box.
- The filter should be performed regardless of the appointment‚Äôs type (SimplePractice or otherwise), but is most vital for SimplePractice locked sessions.
- Prefer a reusable utility function, e.g.,
    ```typescript
    function stripLeadingEmoji(text: string): string {
      return text.replace(/^[\p{Emoji_Presentation}\p{Emoji}\p{So}\p{Sk}\uFE0F]+/gu, '').trim();
    }
    ```

**4. Testing/Validation**
- Review a sample daily PDF where some SimplePractice appointments had locked progress notes (and thus previously had a padlock or emoji).
- Confirm that **no visible emojis, padlocks, or status icons** render in the exported PDF‚Äîthe text is now clean and aligned.
- Appointments with no emoji artifacts should remain unchanged.

**5. Document the Change**
- Briefly explain in the PR or commit message that emoji/status artifacts are now filtered from appointment titles for PDF exports.

**Commit message example:**
```
fix(pdf): Remove emoji/status artifacts from appointment titles in daily template export for SimplePractice locked notes
```

### **Example for Chat:**

```
Important! The Daily Template PDF export still outputs artifacts (emoji, padlock, icons) at the start of SimplePractice appointment titles whenever a note is locked. Strip any leading emoji (üîí or similar) or non-ASCII Unicode from all appointment titles before rendering in the PDF. Only clean the start of the string, not user-entered content. Add this as a filtering utility in the PDF export function and verify with a daily export containing locked/flagged SimplePractice events. Commit with a clear note that locked status emojis are now filtered from appointment titles.
```

**Give the above to Replit‚Äôs AI, or paste it as your issue/feedback.**
