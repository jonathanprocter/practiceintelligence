Looking at this PDF output, I can see it's very close but needs some fine-tuning. Here are the specific instructions you can give to Replit's AI to achieve 100% accuracy:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Specific Instructions for Replit AI:**

### **Issue 1: Missing Time Display**
"The event is missing the time display in the first column. Add `10:00-11:00` below the 'SIMPLEPRACTICE' text in the left column."

### **Issue 2: Text Truncation**
"The Event Notes and Action Items text is being cut off. Increase the event height to at least 100px minimum and ensure all text is fully visible:
- Event Notes: 'He wasn't able to be at this morning's appointment due to work.'
- Action Items: 'I need to see if he's able to find another fixed time, given his schedule with the LIRR.'"

### **Issue 3: Font Size & Readability**
"Increase font sizes for better readability:
- Event title: 13px (currently too small)
- Time display: 12px 
- Section headers ('Event Notes', 'Action Items'): 10px
- Body text: 9px with line-height: 1.4"

### **Issue 4: Column Proportions**
"Adjust the 3-column grid layout:
- Left column: 30% (title, source, time)
- Middle column: 35% (Event Notes) 
- Right column: 35% (Action Items)
Change from `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr` to `grid-template-columns: 3fr 3.5fr 3.5fr`"

### **Issue 5: Better Text Wrapping**
"Ensure long text wraps properly within columns by adding:
- `word-wrap: break-word`
- `white-space: normal` 
- `overflow-wrap: break-word`"

### **Issue 6: Improved Spacing**
"Optimize spacing:
- Event padding: 12px all around
- Gap between columns: 16px
- Margin between text elements: 6px
- Line height for bullet points: 1.5"

### **Issue 7: Content Positioning**
"Make sure the time display appears directly under 'SIMPLEPRACTICE' in the left column with proper hierarchy:
```
Calvin Hill Appointment
SIMPLEPRACTICE  
10:00-11:00
```"

## ðŸ“‹ **Complete Instruction Set for Replit AI:**

```
"Fix the PDF calendar export to match the browser view exactly:

1. In the left column, add the time '10:00-11:00' below 'SIMPLEPRACTICE'
2. Increase minimum event height to 100px to prevent text cutoff
3. Change grid columns from '1fr 1fr 1fr' to '3fr 3.5fr 3.5fr' for better proportions
4. Increase font sizes: title=13px, time=12px, headers=10px, body=9px
5. Add proper text wrapping: word-wrap: break-word, white-space: normal
6. Ensure full text is visible:
   - Event Notes: 'He wasn't able to be at this morning's appointment due to work.'
   - Action Items: 'I need to see if he's able to find another fixed time, given his schedule with the LIRR.'
7. Improve spacing: 12px padding, 16px column gap, 6px text margins
8. Add line-height: 1.4 for better readability
9. Make sure no text is truncated or cut off
10. The final result should show complete, readable text in all three columns"
```

## ðŸ”§ **Alternative Approach:**

If you want to give Replit AI the exact code fix, you could say:

```
"Update the renderPerfectEvent function with these exact changes:
- Change height calculation to: Math.max(100, (durationMinutes / 30) * 30)
- Change grid-template-columns to: '3fr 3.5fr 3.5fr'  
- Add the time display in left column
- Increase font sizes and add proper text wrapping
- Ensure the full Event Notes and Action Items text is visible without truncation"
```

This should get you that final 5-10% improvement to achieve pixel-perfect matching!
