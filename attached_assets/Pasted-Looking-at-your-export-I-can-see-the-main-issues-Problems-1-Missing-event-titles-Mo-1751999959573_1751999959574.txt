Looking at your export, I can see the main issues:

**❌ Problems**:
1. **Missing event titles** - Most events just show "SIMPLEPRACTICE" instead of patient names
2. **Missing time ranges** - Events like the middle ones don't show "10:00-11:00" etc.
3. **Inconsistent rendering** - Only some events show properly

**✅ What's working**:
- "Dan re: Supervision" and "Sherrita Hoosein" show correctly with 3-column layout
- Time grid to 23:30 is perfect
- Event styling (borders) is working

The issue is that the **event title cleaning is too aggressive** and wiping out the titles. Let me fix this:## 🚨 **Critical Issues Identified**

Looking at your export, I can see the **main problem**:

**❌ Most events are missing their titles!** 
- Should show: "Nancy Grossman", "Amberly Comeau", etc.
- Actually showing: Just "SIMPLEPRACTICE" 

**❌ Missing time ranges**
- Should show: "10:00-11:00", "11:00-12:00", etc.
- Actually showing: Nothing

The issue is that my previous text cleaning was **too aggressive** and accidentally removing the event titles entirely!

## 🔧 **Critical Fix**

The fix above addresses this by:

1. **Conservative title cleaning** - Only removes " Appointment" suffix, nothing else
2. **Always render all 3 elements** - Title, source, time for EVERY event
3. **Extensive debugging** - Console logs to see exactly what's happening
4. **Simplified text wrapping** - Avoid character-level issues
5. **Consistent heights** - Every event gets proper space

## 🧪 **Debug Steps**

1. **Replace the function** with the fixed version above
2. **Export again** 
3. **Check browser console** - You'll see detailed logs like:
   ```
   --- Event 3 DEBUG ---
   Original title: "Nancy Grossman Appointment"
   Display title: "Nancy Grossman"
   Drew simple title: "Nancy Grossman"
   Drew simple source: "SIMPLEPRACTICE"
   Drew simple time range: "10:00-11:00"
   ```

## 📊 **Expected Result**

After this fix, **EVERY event** should show:
- ✅ **Patient name** (Nancy Grossman, Amberly Comeau, etc.)
- ✅ **Source** (SIMPLEPRACTICE)
- ✅ **Time range** (10:00-11:00, 11:00-12:00, etc.)

## 🔍 **If Still Not Working**

Add this to your `handleExportAction` function to see the raw event data:

```typescript
console.log('=== RAW EVENT DATA ===');
dayEvents.forEach((event, i) => {
  console.log(`Event ${i+1}:`, {
    title: event.title,
    hasTitle: !!event.title,
    titleLength: event.title?.length,
    source: event.source
  });
});
```

The extensive debugging in the new function will show us exactly what's happening with each event title. This should fix the missing titles and time ranges! 🚀
