Hi! I need help fixing a mismatch between my calendar dashboard and the exported PDF in my RemarkablePlannerPro project.

**Issue:**  
- The dashboard (live view) correctly shows all appointments and their details, but the PDF export either omits some events/data or formats them incorrectly.
- For example, [describe specific date or issue if relevant, e.g., "appointments on July 8th" or "notes for specific clients" are missing in the PDF"].
- See attached screenshots for reference: one of the dashboard and one of the PDF export.

**What I want:**  
- Ensure that all data visible in the dashboard (appointments, notes, action items, etc.) is fully included in the PDF export for the same period.
- Match the schedule layout and formatting in the export to look as close to the dashboard as possible (columns, colors, notes, etc.).

**Code areas to check:**  
- The export logic in `htmlTemplatePDF.ts`, `weeklyPackageExport.ts`, and any relevant utils.

**Please:**  
- Audit the code to verify all relevant fields/data from the dashboard view are included in the export.
- Suggest or make changes so the export is always a true snapshot of the dashboard.
- Let me know if you need the exact screenshots or code snippets.

Thank you!
