To fix the code so that:

- **Appointments move up to the top of the box (vertically aligned at the top)**
- **Time-frames of the appointments show appropriately (clearly and consistently)**

you‚Äôll want to adjust both the **HTML structure** (template strings) and the **CSS styles/classes** that control layout and display.

Here‚Äôs a targeted review and solution:

### 1. Vertically Align Appointments at the Top

**Problem:**  
If appointments are not consistently at the top, it‚Äôs likely because of extra padding/margin in container elements or alignment issues in CSS.

#### Solution:
Make sure the appointment wrapper/container uses a top-aligned flex or grid layout.

**Example CSS (add/adjust as needed):**
```css
.appointment-box {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-start; /* aligns children to top */
  align-items: stretch;
  height: 100%; /* or auto if you don't want stretching */
  padding: 0.5em 1em; /* adjust to your design */
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

**HTML Structure ‚Äì Template String (example change):**
```js
return `
  
    
      ${event.title}
      ${calendarSource}
    
    ${hasLocation ? `üìç ${locationInfo}` : ''}
    ${timeDisplay}
    ${hasAdditionalContent ? `
      ${hasEventNotes ? `${eventNotes}` : ''}
      ${hasActionItems ? `${actionItems}` : ''}
    ` : ''}
  
`;
```

### 2. Show Timeframes Appropriately

**Problem:**  
If times are not showing or the format is inconsistent, it‚Äôs from how `timeDisplay` is created or styled.

#### Solution:
- Make sure `formatTime()` returns a clear, consistent string (e.g., "13:00 - 13:50").
- Always show time in a dedicated spot with proper styling.

**Example of robust formatTime() (already does 24-hour):**
```js
function formatTime(date) {
  return date.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', {
    hour: '2-digit',
    minute: '2-digit',
    hour12: false // 24-hour format
  });
}
```

- Place `timeDisplay` in a prominent div with a class, e.g., `.appointment-time`.
- Make sure in your template that it's always where you want.

**CSS for clarity:**
```css
.appointment-time {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin: 0.25em 0;
  color: #2c3e50;
  font-size: 1.05em;
}
```

### 3. Ensure Single-Column Layout When Needed

You already handle the difference between three-column and single-column with classes.
Just make sure the containers for these layouts use CSS like:

```css
.single-column {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
.three-column {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 0.5em;
}
```

### 4. Final Check

- Confirm you actually **add** the new/updated CSS to your stylesheet OR include it in a `` tag in the HTML template.
- Make sure the elements have the right classes attached in your template string logic.

## Summary of Changes:

- Add/Update the wrapper class (`appointment-box`) to enforce top-aligned flex or grid.
- Place the `timeDisplay` element (`.appointment-time`) directly below the title for clarity.
- Make sure all template strings insert the correct structure and classes.
- Add CSS to reinforce vertical alignment and clear time display.

### Example: Modified HTML Template for a Single Appointment

```js
return `
  
    ${event.title}
    ${timeDisplay}
    ${calendarSource}
    ${hasLocation ? `üìç${locationInfo}` : ''}
    // Add notes and actions as needed...
  
`;
```

### Example: Ensure CSS

```css
.appointment-box {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-start;
}
.appointment-title { font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.1em; }
.appointment-time { color: #2c3e50; font-size: 1.03em; }
```

Apply these adjustments, and your appointments will be top-aligned, with clear timeframes! If you want me to generate a fully patched JS/CSS sample for your use, just say so.
