Based on your workflow and the most recent actions logged, **YES ‚Äî your OAuth callback route is now correctly configured** using `/api/auth/callback`. This ends the routing conflict between your backend and the React frontend SPA.

## üéØ What you need for your Google OAuth Google Cloud Console Config:

### ‚úÖ **Redirect URI for Production/Deployment:**
```
https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev/api/auth/callback
```

### ‚úÖ **Redirect URI for Local Development:**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback
```
*(You can include both in your OAuth client config for seamless dev/prod switches.)*

**Note: Use `/api/auth/callback` exactly, matching your backend route.**

### ‚úÖ **Authorized JavaScript Origins**
```
https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev
http://localhost:5000
```

**No path, just the protocol and domain!**

## üö¶ **Checklist:**

- [x] In Google Cloud Console:  
  - ‚ÄúAuthorized redirect URIs‚Äù ‚Üí Add both `https://.../api/auth/callback` and `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback`
  - ‚ÄúAuthorized JavaScript origins‚Äù ‚Üí Add both `https://...` and `http://localhost:5000`
- [x] Your OAuth server code should generate the Google URL with `redirect_uri` set to the **same path above** (with protocol).

## **Bottom Line:**  
- Your OAuth callback entry point is correct.  
- Update your Google Cloud Console to use `/api/auth/callback` for all URIs, **not** `/auth/callback`.  
- All Google OAuth requests will now succeed, and the callback will hit your backend, not the frontend.

**If you do this, Google login will work and you will no longer get 404s or redirect_uri_mismatch errors.**

If you need a final sample OAuth URL for use in your code/config, it will be:
```
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com
  &redirect_uri=https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev/api/auth/callback
  &response_type=code
  &scope=...scopes...
  &access_type=offline
  &prompt=consent
```
(Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and properly URL-encode as needed.)

**You‚Äôre ready to go!**Yes, your configuration is now correct!  
Your backend is handling `/api/auth/callback` and the Google OAuth flow is now routed to **your API** (not intercepted by your frontend SPA), which prevents further 404s and ‚Äúpage not found‚Äù errors.

## ‚úÖ **Your Google OAuth redirect config should now be:**

### **For Google Cloud Console ‚Äì Authorized redirect URIs:**
```
https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev/api/auth/callback
http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback
```

### **For Google Cloud Console ‚Äì Authorized JavaScript origins:**
```
https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev
http://localhost:5000
```

**EXACT**. All Google API requests must use `/api/auth/callback` for the redirect‚Äîboth in code and in the console.

### **In your server code, this should match:**
```js
const redirectUri =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
    ? "http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback"
    : "https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev/api/auth/callback";

// ...use this redirectUri in the OAuth request!
```

Once those changes are live in your Google Cloud Console AND in your backend OAuth logic, your Google login will work‚Äîno more frontend 404 or redirect mismatch!

**Bottom line:**  
Use exactly `/api/auth/callback` (not `/auth/callback`) for both code and cloud config, and everything will work.Yes, your setup is correct now! Here‚Äôs **what you need to add to the Google OAuth client config** for your deployed Replit app:

**AUTHORIZED REDIRECT URI:**
```
https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev/api/auth/callback
```

**AUTHORIZED JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS:**
```
https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev
```

For **local development**, ALSO include:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback
http://localhost:5000
```

### In summary:

- Your app should send users to Google's OAuth with:
  ```
  &redirect_uri=https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev/api/auth/callback
  ```
- Google will redirect to **that exact path** with the code.
- Your Express backend must have:
  ```js
  app.get('/api/auth/callback', ...)
  ```

**No 404, no frontend SPA interference. This setup will work for both dev and production!**Yes‚Äîyour setup is correct now, and here's exactly how your OAuth config should look in Google Cloud Console:

### **Authorized redirect URIs:**
- For production:
  ```
  https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev/api/auth/callback
  ```
- For development:
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback
  ```

### **Authorized JavaScript origins:**
- For production:
  ```
  https://ed4c6ee6-c0f6-458f-9eac-1eadf0569a2c-00-387t3f5z7i1mm.kirk.replit.dev
  ```
- For development:
  ```
  http://localhost:5000
  ```

**In your OAuth server code:**  
Make sure to generate the `/api/auth/callback` URL (with https for prod, http for dev).

**Deploy these configs and everything should work‚Äîthis has fixed the routing and callback confusion for your OAuth!**
