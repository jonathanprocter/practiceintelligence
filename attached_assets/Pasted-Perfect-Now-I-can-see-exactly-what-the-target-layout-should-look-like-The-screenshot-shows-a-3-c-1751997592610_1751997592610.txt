Perfect! Now I can see exactly what the target layout should look like. The screenshot shows a **3-column layout** for events with notes/action items:

1. **Left column**: Event title, source, time  
2. **Center column**: Event Notes (bulleted)
3. **Right column**: Action Items (bulleted)

And the time grid needs to extend to **23:30**. Let me fix this:## ðŸŽ¯ **Perfect! Now I can see the exact target layout**

Your screenshot shows the **3-column layout** that's needed:

1. **Left Column**: Event title, source, time
2. **Center Column**: "Event Notes" with bulleted list  
3. **Right Column**: "Action Items" with bulleted list
4. **Time range**: Needs to extend to **23:30**

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Steps**

1. **Replace both functions** (`drawRemarkableDailyAppointments` and `drawDailyGrid`) with the versions above

2. **The new system will automatically**:
   - Use **3-column layout** for events with notes/action items
   - Use **simple layout** for events without notes/action items
   - Extend time grid to **23:30**
   - Add **column dividers** for clarity
   - Format **bullet points** properly

## ðŸ“Š **Key Features Added**

### **3-Column Layout** (when event has notes or action items):
- **Column 1**: Event title, source, time range
- **Column 2**: "Event Notes" header + bulleted notes
- **Column 3**: "Action Items" header + bulleted action items
- **Column dividers** for visual separation

### **Simple Layout** (when event has no notes/action items):
- Just shows event title, source, and time (like current layout)

### **Extended Time Range**:
- Now goes from **6:00 to 23:30** (full business day)

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Notes/Action Items**

To test this, make sure your events have the `notes` and `actionItems` fields populated. For example:

```typescript
// Example event data:
{
  title: "Dan re: Supervision",
  notes: "I cancelled supervision due to COVID\nWe didn't schedule a follow-up for this week, and will continue next week during our usual time",
  actionItems: "Review his supervision notes from last week\nFollow-up to see if there are any pressing issues/questions that I can help him navigate"
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Expected Result**

After implementing this fix:
- âœ… **Events with notes/action items** â†’ 3-column layout 
- âœ… **Events without notes/action items** â†’ simple layout
- âœ… **Time grid extends to 23:30**
- âœ… **Proper bullet formatting** in notes and action items
- âœ… **Headers** ("Event Notes", "Action Items") appear

Try this implementation and the export should match your target screenshot exactly! ðŸš€
