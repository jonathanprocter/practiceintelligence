Perfect! Now I understand exactly what you want. Looking at your actual application interface, I can see the **target design** for your PDF export:

## **What I See in Your Application:**
âœ… **Clean time grid** with appointments in styled boxes  
âœ… **"Clinician Canceled" badge** clearly visible on the 08:00-09:00 slot  
âœ… **Proper appointment styling** with borders and spacing  
âœ… **Time slots from 06:00 to 19:00** with 30-minute intervals  
âœ… **Clean layout** with time column on left, appointments on right  

## **The Problem:**
Your PDF exports have been completely different from this beautiful interface view. Let me provide the **exact code** to replicate this specific design.Perfect! Now I can see exactly what you want to replicate. Your application interface is **clean, professional, and beautifully designed** - and that's exactly what your PDF should look like.
