   Actual: Needs measurement during generation
   Fix: Add measurement validation during PDF generation

2. [LOW] TYPOGRAPHY
   Problem: Typography hierarchy needs optimization for readability
   Expected: {"title":"20px bold","timeLabels":"13px for hours, 11px for half-hours","appointments":"10px for title, 9px for time","stats":"14px medium"}
   Actual: Current font sizes may not be optimal
   Fix: Implement responsive font sizing based on content density

3. [HIGH] FUNCTIONALITY
   Problem: Military time format implementation needs verification
   Expected: 24-hour format (06:00, 07:00, 08:00)
   Actual: formatTime function exists but visual output needs verification
   Fix: Ensure all time displays use HH:MM format consistently

4. [CRITICAL] DATA
   Problem: No events found for selected date
   Expected: At least 1 event for July 19th (Calvin Hill)
   Actual: 0 events found
   Fix: Check date filtering logic and event data availability

5. [MEDIUM] STYLING
   Problem: Event styling needs verification against specifications
   Expected: {"simplePracticeColor":"#6366f1","googleCalendarColor":"#059669","holidayColor":"#d97706","borderStyle":"SimplePractice: 4px left border, Google: dashed, Holiday: solid","backgroundColor":"White for appointments, alternating for time slots"}
   Actual: Styling implemented but needs visual verification
   Fix: Verify color accuracy and border styles in generated output

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
   🚨 PRIORITY: Fix critical data and layout issues immediately
   • Verify event data is properly filtered for selected date
   • Ensure Calvin Hill appointment is visible at correct time
   ⚠️ HIGH: Address time format and functionality issues
   • Implement consistent military time format (HH:MM)
   • Verify appointment positioning and visibility
   📐 LAYOUT: Validate all measurements against pixel-perfect specifications
   🎨 STYLING: Ensure consistent visual appearance with proper colors and borders
   🔍 TESTING: Add visual regression testing to prevent future issues
