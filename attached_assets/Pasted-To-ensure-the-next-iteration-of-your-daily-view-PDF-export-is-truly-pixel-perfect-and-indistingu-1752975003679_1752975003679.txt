To ensure the **next iteration of your daily view PDF export is truly pixel-perfect** and indistinguishable from your browser view, you should provide Replit (or any AI/code assistant) with the following, all in one prompt or ticket:

## 1. **A Live Sample Event/Appointment JSON**

Paste an **actual** event object (from your API, mock, or network call—see example below).  
This should be the exact same shape as used by the daily view, with all expected fields (including nested notes/actionItems as arrays if that’s what you use).

```json
{
  "id": "calvin-hill-appt",
  "title": "Calvin Hill Appointment",
  "description": "Annual check-in",
  "startTime": "2025-07-19T10:00:00.000Z",
  "endTime": "2025-07-19T11:00:00.000Z",
  "source": "simplepractice",
  "color": "#6495ED",
  "notes": [
    "Bring insurance paperwork",
    "Arrive 10 minutes early"
  ],
  "actionItems": [
    "Collect copay",
    "Update medical record"
  ],
  "status": "scheduled",
  "location": "telehealth"
}
```

## 2. **The Actual JSX/HTML Markup for One Event Block**

Copy from your `DailyView.tsx` (or subcomponent) the code that **renders a single appointment**—including all important class names and structure that make up the visual block.  
_(This is what is actually rendered to the browser.)_

```jsx

  
    10:00
    {event.title}
  
  
    Notes
    {event.notes.map(note => {note})}
  
  
    Action Items
    {event.actionItems.map(item => {item})}
  

```

## 3. **The CSS for Appointment Blocks**

Copy the **full CSS** (from `index.css` or wherever relevant) for everything needed to render the appointment EXACTLY as it looks in your browser.

```css
.appointment.simplepractice {
  background: #FFFFFF !important;
  color: black !important;
  border: 2px solid #6495ED !important;
  border-left: 8px solid #6495ED !important;
  box-shadow: none !important;
  border-radius: 0 !important;
}
.appointment-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 8px;
  align-items: start;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 4px;
}
.appointment-notes-header,
.appointment-actions-header {
  font-size: 12px;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 3px;
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-align: left;
}
.appointment-left .appointment-time {
  font-size: 24px !important;
  font-weight: bold !important;
  color: #000 !important;
  opacity: 1 !important;
}
.time-slot {
  min-height: 40px;
}
```

## 4. **Screenshots (Optional but Highly Recommended!)**

- Attach a browser screenshot of the appointment as you see it in the daily view.
- Attach a screenshot of the **most recent PDF** (showing discrepancies).

## 5. **Describe What’s Still Off (if you know)**

For example:  
- “Left border color is correct but thickness is off.”  
- “PDF font is sans-serif, but browser uses system-ui.”  
- “Text wrapping doesn’t match.”  
- “Slot heights or event vertical alignment are not correct.”

## 6. **Summary Instructions For Perfection**

> “Use this event JSON, JSX block, and CSS to create a PDF that is visually indistinguishable from the browser. Every detail (fonts, colors, borders, alignments, spacing, slot heights, etc.) must match exactly.  
> Do NOT perform any timezone conversion.  
> The PDF is not ‘good enough’ unless it is idempotent to a screenshot of the daily view in Chrome.”

**Paste all of the above into your issue, discussion, or prompt. This is what makes a product/dev team (or AI assistant) most likely to close the last 1–2% accuracy gap for a truly pixel-perfect export.**

If you need help assembling any of the items above, just say which one and I'll give you exact steps to capture/copy it!
