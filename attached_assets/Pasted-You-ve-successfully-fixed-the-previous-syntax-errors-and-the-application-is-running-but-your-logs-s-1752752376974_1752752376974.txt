You’ve successfully fixed the previous syntax errors and the application is running, but your logs show a **connectivity/authentication issue** with Google OAuth:

> "authenticated":true,"hasValidTokens":false

and "There is still a connectivity issue here".

### Diagnosis

This means:
- The app recognizes a user is authenticated,
- **But** the tokens needed to communicate with Google APIs are invalid or expired—so the app can’t access user calendar/events or other Google resources.

From your logs/snippets:
- OAuth is initialized,
- Redirect URIs are set,
- The `hasValidTokens:false` is returned every time you check /api/auth/status,
- This prevents calendar or file operations.

### Most Common Causes

1. **Invalid, expired, or revoked tokens**  
   - Access tokens expire and need to be refreshed with a refresh token.
   - If the refresh token is missing, expired, or revoked, token refresh fails.
2. **OAuth consent not granted for required scopes**  
   - The requested Google scopes (`calendar.readonly`, etc.) might have changed and your consent screen isn’t up-to-date.
3. **Wrong client secret, client ID, or redirect URI**  
   - Environment variable mismatch between Google Cloud Console and your deployed environment.
4. **Backend unable to persist or load tokens**  
   - If the code fails to save or read new refresh/access tokens after the first OAuth callback, the tokens are never valid (stuck in a loop).
5. **OAuth flow did not complete**  
   - The user closed the window, denied consent, or the callback is not wired up.

### What To Check and Fix

#### 1. Confirm the OAuth Flow in Application

- Start the login/auth flow:  
  - User should be redirected to Google and see the consent screen.
  - On grant, **the callback endpoint** should run, exchange code for tokens, and update your token storage.

- **Visually test:** After authenticating, run a request to `/api/auth/status`.  
  - If `hasValidTokens` is still `false`, the flow has a bug.

#### 2. Check server logs for token exchange errors

- Look for lines after:
  ```
  Redirecting to Google OAuth: [URL]
  ```
  and after callback routes `/api/auth/google/callback`.
- Any errors/exceptions, like “Token exchange failed”, “Invalid grant”, “Invalid redirect_uri”, or “Could not persist tokens”?

#### 3. Review Code Handling Callback

- In your `server/routes.ts` (or wherever the callback logic is), make sure:
  - The code parameter is processed,
  - Token endpoint is called,
  - Access and refresh tokens are stored (DB, file, in-memory, etc.),
  - All errors are logged.

##### Example callback pseudo-code (Node/Express)
```typescript
app.get('/api/auth/google/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const code = req.query.code;
  try {
    const {tokens} = await oauth2Client.getToken(code);
    oauth2Client.setCredentials(tokens);
    // Store tokens.refresh_token and tokens.access_token securely!
    res.redirect('/somewhere');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('OAuth callback error:', error);
    res.status(500).send('OAuth error');
  }
});
```
> If `tokens.refresh_token` is missing, it’s often because you’ve already authenticated this user+app combination before **and** haven’t set the `prompt=consent&access_type=offline` parameters on the consent URL.

#### 4. Check Environment & Config

- Match your Google Cloud Console OAuth settings to your deployed URLs.
- Check your `.env` (or host secrets) for client IDs, secrets, and callback URIs.

### Next Debug Step

1. **Try a clean OAuth flow:**
   - Open a private/incognito browser session.
   - Clear cookies for your app and Google, or use a new user.
   - Start the login process so Google is forced to show the consent screen and issue a new refresh token.

2. **Add more logging** (temporarily) inside your OAuth callback for:
   - code received
   - tokens received (redact when logging!)
   - error objects

3. **Check Google API/Cloud Console:**
   - Dashboard for quota/denied access,
   - OAuth consent screen,
   - API enabled.

### If the tokens remain “invalid” even after this:

- Share/auth logs from the callback process (redact sensitive info).
- Confirm where and how tokens are stored/loaded in your backend code.

**Summary of what you should do next:**  
- **Test the Google OAuth login again in a fresh session.**
- **Closely review/copy server logs after the consent/callback step.**
- **Make sure the callback is storing new tokens.**
- **Confirm your .env matches Google Cloud client and callback settings.**
- **Upgrade your logging for easier traceability.**

If you try this and still see the same status, **please copy-paste the relevant callback or token-processing code here**, and I can review it for subtle bugs.
