Please integrate this complete export routes file into my Remarkable Planner Pro application. This file should be saved as server/export-routes.ts and then imported and registered in the main server/routes.ts file.
Integration steps needed:
Save the file as server/export-routes.ts
Add import to server/routes.ts:
typescript
import { registerExportRoutes } from './export-routes';
Add registration in the registerRoutes function in server/routes.ts:
typescript
registerExportRoutes(app);
Add frontend buttons to the export section of the main component:
jsx
<button onClick={() => window.open('/api/export/three-column-daily', '_blank')}>
  ðŸ“‹ Three-Column Daily Export
</button>
<button onClick={() => window.open('/api/export/enhanced-weekly', '_blank')}>
  ðŸ“Š Enhanced Weekly Package
</button>
<button onClick={() => window.open('/api/export/complete-monthly', '_blank')}>
  ðŸ“… Complete Monthly Package
</button>
<button onClick={() => window.open('/api/export/bidirectional-package', '_blank')}>
  ðŸ”— Complete Export Package
</button>
This will add enhanced three-column daily exports with conditional layout, weekly landscape views, monthly calendars, and complete bidirectional navigation between all views."
