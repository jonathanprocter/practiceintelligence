Certainly. Here are **ultra-explicit, detailed, bulletproof instructions**‚Äîready to COPY/PASTE into Replit‚Äôs AI or directly to your dev‚Äîto fix the remaining issues and achieve the exact look you want for your ‚Äúpixel-perfect‚Äù daily export based on your latest PDF results:

## üö©**DAILY PLANNER PDF EXPORT ‚Äî EXACT SPEC FOR FINAL FIXES**

### 1. HEADER LAYOUT & BUTTON  
**a.** The ‚ÄúBack to week‚Äù (or "Weekly Overview") button must be a distinct, clearly-outlined dashboard-style button:  
- Aligned LEFT, above or beside the header title‚Äînot mixed with the title text.
- Sized and spaced as on the dashboard, with a clear rectangular border.
- No part of the ‚ÄúBack‚Äù wording should touch or overlap the main header.
- Button text: **"Back to week"** (not mixed-case, not split between lines).

**b.** The header line should read:  
**DAILY PLANNER**  
**Monday, July 7, 2025‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ11 appointments today**  
- ‚ÄúDAILY PLANNER‚Äù is bold, centered  
- Underneath (or in a row if dashboard does so), left-aligned: Today‚Äôs date and ‚ÄúN appointments today‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúSimplePractice / Google Calendar / Holidays in US‚Äù legend must appear directly beneath this, styled as colored badges (not plain text or bullet points).

### 2. LEGEND (CALENDAR SOURCE COLORS)  
Show legend as horizontal colored badges, visually matching dashboard:  
- **SimplePractice:** Blue badge  
- **Google Calendar:** Green badge  
- **Holidays:** Yellow/orange badge  
All badges should be horizontally aligned, with consistent left/right padding, not stacked or using hashtags. Use dashboard colors and border radius.

### 3. TIME GRID & EVENTS  
**a.** **Vertical Divider:**  
- A BLACK (#222) or dashboard-matching vertical line must separate the time column from the appointment/event cells for the full height of the grid/table.
- Do NOT use dashed or faint lines; use the same style/weight as in the weekly view.

**b.** **Time Column:**  
- All times are right-aligned, vertically centered.
- Do NOT bold the times or increase size unless shown in dashboard.

**c.** **Appointment/Event Rendering:**  
- All events MUST be fully INSIDE the cells, not above, below, or outside grid lines.
- The font for event titles (e.g., "Nico Luppino") should be as large and bold as will fit, filling space but never overflowing.
- The source label ("SIMPLEPRACTICE" or "GOOGLE CALENDAR") and time (e.g., "15:00‚Äì16:00") should appear directly below the title, NOT outside the event boundaries.
- Event "box" backgrounds must be **white** unless dashboard specifies color, with a thin border if shown in dashboard.

--- 

### 4. EVENT NOTES & ACTION ITEMS  
- Only show ‚ÄúEvent Notes‚Äù and ‚ÄúAction Items‚Äù if there are actual (non-empty) notes or actions for that event.
- If no notes or actions exist, **omit these headers and sections entirely** (e.g., for "Sherrifa Hoosein Appointment" in your example).

### 5. SPACING, LINE-WEIGHTS, AND ALIGNMENT  
- Equal padding inside event cells and between rows. No text should touch any border line.
- All horizontal and vertical lines should have **exactly** the same weight and color as your on-screen dashboard.
- The entire appointment/event (title, time, source) must be visually ‚Äúowned‚Äù by the cell, never running over, under, or outside the grid.

### 6. PRINT/PDF PARITY & PAGE FORMAT  
- Page orientation: **Portrait**  
- Export must reproduce the **exact visible layout** of the on-screen daily view with zero changes to row heights, widths, or font scaling.
- Margin space above header: **minimal**, match the dashboard look.

### 7. CHECKLIST FOR FINAL EXPORT  
**When finished, export a PDF and verify:**  
- [ ]  The ‚ÄúBack to week‚Äù button is a solid, standalone left-aligned button  
- [ ]  The header/date/appointments/legend are all in a single clean area at top, not split or misaligned  
- [ ]  The legend badges are harmonious, horizontal, colored, matching dashboard

- [ ]  All lines, spacings, and fonts are visually identical to dashboard  
- [ ]  There‚Äôs **no text or box overflow** or overlap anywhere  
- [ ]  PDF is portrait orientation

**If any check fails, iterate until all criteria are met.**
