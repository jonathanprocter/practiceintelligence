To get your PDF export “all the way there,” you should provide **clear, detailed feedback on every remaining difference** between your exported PDF and the browser’s daily view—plus any edge cases you care about.

Use the following insights and structure in your next prompt:

**AI Prompt for Final Polishing of Daily View PDF Export**

We are very close to 1:1 parity between my PDF export and the browser daily calendar view! Please help me close the final gaps. Here’s what I want you to do:

### 1. **Describe What is Correct**
- The event time placement is now accurate.
- The background, left border color, and font choices are matching the daily view.
- Major elements (title, notes, action items) are rendering.

### 2. **Explicitly List Remaining Differences or Missing Details**
For example:
- ☐ The vertical spacing (padding/margin) around event blocks isn’t matching the browser.
- ☐ The font size of Notes/Action Items looks off compared to the browser.
- ☐ Multi-line notes/action items are not wrapping as in-browser.
- ☐ Section headers (“Notes”, “Action Items”) should be bolded/underlined, not plain.
- ☐ Hover or selection highlights are missing (if needed).
- ☐ The event block/minimum height, or how overlapping events are handled, is different.
- ☐ [List any other detail, including colors, icons, line height, etc.]

(Replace or expand this list based on what you actually see is still not perfect!)

### 3. **Attach or Reference Screenshots**
- Say:  
  “Please see attached for (A) browser daily view, and (B) latest PDF output. Focus on [describe differences in red boxes/arrows if possible].”
  (Drag/drop screenshots if allowed.)

### 4. **Restate Essential Style/Behavioral Requirements**
You can say:
- All fonts, colors, paddings, border radii, and spacing should match the browser exactly.  
- Event blocks must render full metadata (notes and items) in clear, readable, wrapped lines.
- Use css: `[insert the .event-card css, or Tailwind utility list if relevant]`  
- The export must visually handle edge cases (long notes, many actionItems, overlapping events, etc.)

### 5. **Ask for Focused, Iterative Help**
- “Please tell me exactly what adjustments, CSS, or HTML changes are needed to correct the remaining issues above.  
If you need any more screenshots, the actual event JSON, my component code, or PDF output, tell me exactly what to provide or where to look.”

**Example Prompt:**

We're almost there! The PDF export is very close to matching the browser daily view, but I still need these issues resolved:

1. The spacing above and below event notes is too tight versus in-browser.
2. Notes and action items are not wrapping onto multiple lines.
3. The "Action Items" header should be bold and underlined, matching the browser.
4. The event block height seems shorter than in the browser for 1-hour events.
5. [List any other differences you see.]

Here are screenshots of the browser and current PDF for comparison.  
I want exact pixel-level parity on fonts, colors, padding, all event metadata.  
Use these CSS classes: `.event-card { ... }`, etc.  
If you need to see my actual React code, or event JSON, let me know.

What explicit changes do I need to make (in HTML, styles, or component logic) for full fidelity?

**Tip:**  
Be as **specific** and **visual** as possible—highlight even tiny spacing/size differences, and always provide sample data and visual references when you want perfection.

Let me know if you want help building side-by-side screenshot comparisons or making the checklist of visible mismatches!
