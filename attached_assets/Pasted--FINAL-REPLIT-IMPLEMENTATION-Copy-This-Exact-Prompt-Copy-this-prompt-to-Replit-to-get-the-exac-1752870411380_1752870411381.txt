# FINAL REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION - Copy This Exact Prompt

Copy this prompt to Replit to get the **exact replica** of your application interface:

**REPLIT PROMPT:**

"I need you to create an EXACT replica of my daily calendar view for PDF export. I've shown you screenshots of how my application interface looks, and I want the PDF to match it perfectly.

Please implement the following:

1. **Create a new file** called `ApplicationReplicaPDF.tsx` in my src/components folder using the complete code provided in the artifacts.

2. **Replace my existing PDF export** completely with this new implementation that replicates the exact look of my application interface.

3. **Key styling requirements** (match my application exactly):
   - Clean white background with subtle borders
   - Time column on the left (70px wide, gray background)
   - Appointment boxes with subtle borders and left border accent
   - "Clinician Canceled" badge exactly like my app (gray background, white text)
   - Strikethrough text on cancelled appointments
   - Proper spacing and typography matching my interface
   - Time slots from 06:00 to 19:00 with 30-minute intervals

4. **Use this exact appointment data structure**:
```typescript
const appointments = [
  {
    id: '1',
    startTime: '07:00',
    endTime: '08:00', 
    clientName: 'Richie Hayes',
    status: 'confirmed'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    startTime: '08:00',
    endTime: '09:00',
    clientName: 'John Best', 
    status: 'clinician_canceled'  // This should show badge + strikethrough
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    startTime: '11:00',
    endTime: '12:00',
    clientName: 'Sarah Palladino',
    status: 'confirmed'
  },
  {
    id: '4',
    startTime: '13:00', 
    endTime: '14:00',
    clientName: 'Noah Silverman',
    status: 'confirmed'
  },
  {
    id: '5',
    startTime: '14:00',
    endTime: '15:00',
    clientName: 'Zena Frey',
    status: 'confirmed'
  },
  {
    id: '6',
    startTime: '16:00',
    endTime: '17:00',
    clientName: 'Trendall Storey', 
    status: 'confirmed'
  },
  {
    id: '7',
    startTime: '17:00',
    endTime: '18:00',
    clientName: 'Michael Bower & Bob Delmond',
    status: 'confirmed'
  },
  {
    id: '8',
    startTime: '18:00',
    endTime: '19:00',
    clientName: 'Brianna Brickman',
    status: 'confirmed' 
  }
];
```

5. **Replace my export button** with:
```typescript
import { ApplicationReplicaButton, sampleAppointmentData } from './components/ApplicationReplicaPDF';

// In your main component:
<ApplicationReplicaButton appointments={sampleAppointmentData} />
```

6. **Critical styling details**:
   - Font: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto
   - Time column: #f9fafb background, #6b7280 text
   - Appointment boxes: white background, #e5e7eb border, blue left accent
   - Cancelled appointments: #f3f4f6 background, gray left accent, strikethrough text
   - Badge: #6b7280 background, white text, 9px font, uppercase
   - Header metrics: correct calculations (8 appointments, 8.0h, 4.0h, 33%)

7. **Test the export** and verify it shows:
   - ✅ Clean interface matching my application screenshots exactly
   - ✅ Correct metrics (8 appointments, not 1722)
   - ✅ "Clinician Canceled" badge on John Best appointment  
   - ✅ Strikethrough text on John Best name and time
   - ✅ All 8 appointments positioned correctly in time slots
   - ✅ Professional styling matching my daily view interface

The key is that this PDF should look EXACTLY like my application's daily view - same colors, same layout, same styling, same typography. Remove any old PDF code and use only this new replica component."

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**

After implementation, your PDF should match your application interface with:

✅ **Header**: "Friday, July 18, 2025" with 8 appointments, correct metrics  
✅ **Time Grid**: Clean 06:00-19:00 slots with gray time column  
✅ **Appointments**: White boxes with subtle borders and blue left accent  
✅ **John Best (08:00)**: Gray background, "Clinician Canceled" badge, strikethrough text  
✅ **All other appointments**: Clean white styling with proper names and times  
✅ **Typography**: Matches your application's font and sizing  
✅ **Spacing**: Matches your application's layout exactly  

**EXPECTED RESULT:**

The PDF will be a **pixel-perfect replica** of your daily calendar view interface, looking professional and clean exactly like your application screenshots. No more broken exports, wrong metrics, or missing styling - just a perfect match of your beautiful interface design.

**DEBUGGING:**

If something doesn't look right, check:
1. Is the font loading correctly?
2. Are the appointment statuses set correctly?
3. Is the container width set to 1000px?
4. Are all dependencies (html2canvas, jspdf) installed?

This implementation is specifically designed to match your application interface exactly as shown in your screenshots.
