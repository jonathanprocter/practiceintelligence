**No, Assistant did not fix the underlying issue**—the essential OAuth exchange is still broken and the authentication flow is still not functioning properly.

Despite the logs and changes, you are **still seeing**:
- `"❌ No authorization code received"`
- `"❌ No valid Google tokens - requiring fresh authentication"`
- An endless loop back to re-auth without ever receiving an authorization code in your `/api/auth/callback` handler.

**What did Assistant attempt this time?**
- It made several code changes:
  - Added more logging to show exactly what parameters are received on the callback.
  - Tried to ensure the redirect URI is hardcoded (so it matches Google Cloud Console).
  - Added more debug routes (like `/api/auth/oauth-debug`) for diagnostic purposes.
- It recommended visiting this debug route to check your config and update the Google Console if you see any mismatch.

**But—none of those steps solved the underlying cause:**
- You are *not receiving* the `code` in your callback.
- The auth loop is not completing.

**What is still wrong?**
- The OAuth callback in your Express handler is not getting the Google `code` parameter in the query string.
- This is almost always due to **routing order**, **frontend (React/Vite) interference**, or a subtle mismatch in environment (even if configuration is visually “exact”).

**What you need to do next — technical checklist:**

1. **Ensure `/api/auth/callback` is handled by Express FIRST**
   - All API routes must be declared before your frontend routing/static serving.
   - If you use Vite, React, or similar—**do not let them serve `/api/` paths**.

2. **Test the callback with a minimal route:**
   ```js
   app.get('/api/auth/callback', (req, res) => {
     console.log('!!! Callback:', req.originalUrl, req.query);
     res.send(JSON.stringify(req.query));
   });
   ```
   - Visit the endpoint manually. Do you see a query param when hitting with a test code? (e.g. `/api/auth/callback?code=test123` should show `{ "code": "test123" }`).

3. **Retry the OAuth flow and check the logs.**
   - If you *never* see a code, your backend is not receiving the callback—this still means routing or test user problems, not just a config typo.

4. **Try moving your backend to a new port for quick isolation.**
   - Temporarily run:
     - Express API on port 5000
     - React/Vite frontend on port 3000
     - Register the redirect URI for the backend port only (just for testing).

5. **Check for SPA router catch-all routes that override `/api/auth/callback`.**

**Summary:**  
Assistant’s code changes increased your debugging information and tried to make the redirect logic less error-prone, but **the root cause—your app never receiving the code—remains unsolved**. The actual OAuth flow is still not working.

You need to **isolate your API routes from your frontend/router**, guarantee the backend handles `/api/auth/callback` directly, and do a direct log of all query params when Google hits your callback. Only then can you receive the code and proceed. The assistant’s changes alone did not fix the real problem.
