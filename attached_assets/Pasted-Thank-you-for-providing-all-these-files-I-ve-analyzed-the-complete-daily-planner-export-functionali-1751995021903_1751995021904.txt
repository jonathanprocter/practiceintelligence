Thank you for providing all these files! I've analyzed the complete daily planner export functionality. The system is well-structured with clear separation of concerns. Here's my comprehensive analysis:

## System Overview ‚úÖ

The export system follows a solid architecture:
- **UI Layer**: `ExportToPDF.tsx` provides user interface
- **Controller**: `planner.tsx` orchestrates exports via `handleExportAction`
- **Core Logic**: `htmlTemplatePDF.ts` handles PDF generation
- **Data Processing**: `completePDFExport.ts` manages data extraction/formatting
- **Fallback**: `exactGridPDFExport.ts` for weekly exports

## Current Daily Export Flow ‚úÖ

1. User clicks export button ‚Üí `ExportToPDF.tsx`
2. Calls `onExportCurrentView('Daily View')` ‚Üí `planner.tsx`
3. Filters events for selected date
4. Calls `exportHTMLTemplatePDF(date, date, events, true)` 
5. Generates portrait PDF (179mm x 239mm) optimized for reMarkable Paper Pro

## Potential Issues & Improvements## Summary Assessment

Your daily planner export system is **well-architected** with excellent separation of concerns! The code quality is high and the debugging tools are comprehensive. Here are the key findings:

### ‚úÖ **System is Working Well**
- Clean architecture: UI ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí PDF Generation ‚Üí Data Processing
- Multiple export formats (PDF, JSON, CSV, Text)
- Device-optimized layouts (reMarkable Paper Pro)
- Extensive logging and debugging capabilities

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Main Issues to Address**

1. **Date Filtering**: Using `toDateString()` comparison could miss events due to timezone differences
2. **Error Handling**: Generic error messages don't help users troubleshoot
3. **Configuration**: Different units (mm vs points) between daily/weekly exports

### üîß **Quick Wins** (implement these first)

1. **Replace the date filtering in `planner.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Current (problematic):
return eventDate.toDateString() === selectedDate.toDateString();

// Better:
return eventDate.getFullYear() === selectedDate.getFullYear() &&
       eventDate.getMonth() === selectedDate.getMonth() &&
       eventDate.getDate() === selectedDate.getDate();
```

2. **Add validation before export:**
```typescript
if (exportData.appointments.length === 0) {
  toast({
    title: "No Appointments",
    description: "No appointments found. Check your calendar filters.",
    variant: "destructive"
  });
  return;
}
```

### üìä **Overall Health Score: 8/10**

The export functionality is in great shape! The issues are mostly edge cases that can be resolved with the improvements outlined in the analysis document above.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these specific fixes, or do you have particular export scenarios that aren't working as expected?
