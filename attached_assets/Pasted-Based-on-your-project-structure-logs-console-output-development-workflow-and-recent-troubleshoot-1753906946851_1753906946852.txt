Based on your project structure, logs, console output, development workflow, and recent troubleshooting steps, here are the **key issues that still need to be addressed** for your application to be fully functional with all Google, SimplePractice, PDF export, calendar sync, and AI workflow features completely integrated and working:

## 1. **Authentication & Session Persistence**

- **Session Not Persisting:**  
  Your logs and behavior indicate that after Google OAuth, the user is not recognized as authenticated (401 errors persist, repeated "Authentication Required" messages).  
  > **To fix:**  
  - Ensure that the OAuth callback updates the session with the correct user object (never hardcode IDs).
  - Verify that the `express-session` or cookie middleware is configured properly for `.replit.dev` and development.  
  - Set cookies as `secure: false` (or based on `process.env.NODE_ENV`), `httpOnly: false` or `true` as appropriate, and `sameSite: 'lax'` or `'none'` as the environment requires.
  - Always use the actual user id from the database and avoid hardcoded IDs (see below).

## 2. **User Management & User ID Consistency**

- **User ID Mismatch:**  
  Persistent problems with using a default user ID (`1`) but the DB may return a different (e.g., `2`) ID. Event and sync endpoints can fail if they tie to a non-existent or wrong user.  
  > **To fix:**  
  - Always query and operate by a unique attribute (username/email), never assuming the ID.
  - Refactor all database operations (fetch, create events) to use the dynamically resolved user ID.
  - Make sure every part of session/user logic (including Passport serialization/deserialization) uses the correct ID and profile.

## 3. **Database Initialization & Error Handling**

- **Failed User Creation/Constraint Violations:**  
  Foreign key errors indicate user event creation is attempted for missing users, or new users are not properly initialized in the database.  
  > **To fix:**  
  - Make DB insertion/resolution of "default user" (or OAuth-based user) atomic and idempotent—never duplicate, always upsert.
  - Add robust error handling/logging for all DB operations—track when/why user/event creation fails.

## 4. **OAuth Token Refresh and Storage**

- **Missing Refresh Tokens:**  
  Your tokens may expire and the frontend may not be able to re-authenticate without forcing a user login.  
  > **To fix:**  
  - Ensure the OAuth request includes the right `access_type='offline'` and `prompt='consent'` to get and store refresh tokens.
  - Store refresh tokens securely in your DB (not just memory/session).
  - Implement background refresh or silent login on session expiry.

## 5. **WebSocket/HMR/Frontend Dev Experience**

- **Vite HMR Errors:**  
  WebSocket connection failures are disrupting live reload/dev experience.  
  > **To fix:**  
  - Make sure Vite is configured to use a free port (`5174` or otherwise) that matches your dev environment.
  - Confirm WebSocket proxy or CORS settings are correct in `vite.config.js` (especially true on Replit).

## 6. **API/Endpoint Routing and Integration**

- **Endpoint Routing Mismatches:**  
  Sometimes `/api/auth/status` or others may reference the wrong session or user.  
  > **To fix:**  
  - Ensure every protected endpoint uses the current authenticated user from session, not a hardcoded ID.
  - Confirm that after OAuth, your client always refreshes user state from the backend.

## 7. **Full Feature Integration Checks**

- **Google Calendar/Drive & SimplePractice:**  
  Even after auth/session fixes, the sync and export features must work for the *currently authenticated user*.  
  > **To fix:**  
  - Test calendar event fetching, event creation/deletion, PDF export to Google Drive, and data synchronization for the just-logged-in user.
  - Ensure that events and exports are not cross-user-mixed—a unique authenticated user only sees their data.

## 8. **Application Secrets & Deployment**

- Make sure that all `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, DB credentials, and session secrets are set in Replit Secrets (never hardcoded in `.env` for public repos).
- Review and finalize all Mary doc configs for OAuth URIs and callback paths (see your `CURRENT_OAUTH_URLS.md` and deployment `.md` files).

## 9. **Testing & Edge Cases**

- **Sign in, sign out, switch accounts**
- **Expiring tokens and silent refresh**
- **Multiple users on the same install/domain**
- **Mobile compatibility/auth flow**

## 10. **Cleanup & Documentation**

- Remove redundant, unused, or hardcoded test users and events from your DB.
- Finalize user-facing documentation and troubleshooting for any non-obvious deployment or consent screen quirks (see your various `*_AUDIT.md` and `*_STATUS.md` files).

**If you address these areas—especially the session persistence, user ID consistency, and OAuth/session handshake bugs—your app will be fully functional and all "integrated" features should work as designed.**
