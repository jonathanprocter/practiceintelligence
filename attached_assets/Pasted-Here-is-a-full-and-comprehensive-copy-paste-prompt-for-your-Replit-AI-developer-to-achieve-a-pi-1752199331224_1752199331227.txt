Here is a **full and comprehensive, copy-paste prompt** for your Replit AI/developer to achieve a pixel-perfect daily planner PDF export with all your requested features and polish:

# Pixel-Perfect Daily Planner PDF Export — FINAL SPEC

Please address the following details in the daily PDF export to fully match the dashboard and my requirements:

## 1. HEADER & NAVIGATION

- Place a large, **DAILY PLANNER** title at the top, centered and bold.
- Just below (or beside, if dashboard shows this), display:  
  `Monday, July 7, 2025     11 appointments today`
  - Use proper font weights and alignment to match dashboard.
- **Legend badges** for "SimplePractice", "Google Calendar", "Holidays in US" must display directly under header, horizontally aligned, with actual dashboard colors, rounded pill shapes, and light font.
- Above and left-aligned, show a **distinct "Back to week" button**:
  - _It must be a “pill”/oval style button, not a rectangle:_
    - Solid border (#222 or dashboard color), border-radius: 999px, padding: 8px 22px, background: #fff, bold button text.
    - Proper margin and spacing from the header/title.
    - Button text must say **"Back to week"** (not split or lower-case).

## 2. GRID & LAYOUT

- The time column is right-aligned, vertically centered, and separated from the appointment/event cell area by a **solid, black (or dashboard color) vertical line**—exact style as in the weekly view.
- Each time row (06:00, 06:30 ...) should be visually aligned and well-spaced, matching row heights/thickness to dashboard.
- All appointment/event text (title, source, time) must be **fully inside their grid cell**, never on or outside a table/cell border.
- The event title ("David Grossman", etc.) is the largest, boldest type in the cell; source label ("SIMPLEPRACTICE" or "GOOGLE CALENDAR") appears beneath, followed by the time, all inside the cell.

## 3. EVENT NOTES & ACTION ITEMS

- Only display "Event Notes" and "Action Items" IF there is content for that event.
- When displayed, the section headers **"Event Notes" and "Action Items"** must be bold, e.g.:
  ```
  **Event Notes**
  - Text here...
  **Action Items**
  - Text here...
  ```
  (Use font-weight: bold or tag  for headers; the item bullet text is regular weight.)
- If no event notes/action items for an appointment (e.g., Sherrifa Hoosein), DO NOT render the headers or any blank section.

## 4. SPACING, FONT, AND STYLE

- The font size for event titles should be maximized to fill available vertical space within their cell, but always remain inside the event grid.
- Visual weight, line height, and grid spacing should precisely match what's seen in the dashboard.
- All lines, borders, padding, and colors should be pixel-for-pixel identical to dashboard.  
- NO element (button, legend, event, note) may overflow or overlap any grid/table/cell boundary.
- The page must export to PDF in **portrait orientation** with minimal top/bottom margin.

## 5. CHECKLIST FOR FINAL EXPORT

- [ ] "Back to week" is a **fully rounded pill/oval button**, visually separated and aligned left
- [ ] Header/title/date/appointments/legend areas are properly centered and aligned, no overlap or crowding
- [ ] Legend badges are true dashboard color, pill-style, properly spaced
- [ ] Solid vertical divider separates time column from event area, matching weekly view
- [ ] Event/appointment cell contents are large, bold, neatly within their grid, never overlapping lines
- [ ] “Event Notes” and “Action Items” **only appear if non-empty and always bolded**
- [ ] No cell background is colored unless dashboard shows it; all appointment cells are white with subtle border if needed
- [ ] Page layout matches dashboard portrait, with no extra whitespace or crowding
- [ ] **Final PDF matches dashboard view side-by-side before approving**

**Please execute all the above, test, and provide a comparison screenshot with dashboard AND the new PDF. Iterate until all checks pass.**

For the “Back to week” pill button you may use:
```css
.back-to-week-btn {
  border: 1.5px solid #222;
  border-radius: 999px;
  padding: 8px 22px;
  background: #fff;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 1rem;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
If there are any differences left, please describe precisely what is different.
