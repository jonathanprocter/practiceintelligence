What Are the Remaining/Were the Main Problems?
1. Session Persistence Between Browser and API
Past Issue: Your backend "force-fix" or command-line authentication produced an authenticated session, but your browser was NOT using the same session/cookie, triggering 401/403 errors.

Recent Fix: You implemented a browser-driven force-fix to synchronize session and authentication cookies from the UI/client itself, not just the server.

Current State: Recent logs suggest sessions are now being deserialized and used correctly in the same browser session, with the right user and tokens attached.

2. OAuth Redirect URI Configuration
Past Problems: Mismatched/case-sensitive/copy-paste errors in redirect URIs (or using HTTP instead of HTTPS) will break OAuth on Google.

Current State: The logs and recent successful token validation suggest your OAuth redirect is now correctly registered and matches the running app.

3. WebSocket/HMR Issues
Vite HMR (hot module reload) was disconnecting or port-conflicting.

Fix: You changed HMR port and cleaned up session middleware—no critical HMR errors remain (unless you still see [vite] failed to connect to websocket repeatedly, in which case ignore for live-app usage but fix for dev comfort).

4. User Logic & Orphaned Sessions
Earlier issues stemmed from:

Hardcoded/default user fallback logic

Orphaned or duplicate users in the DB

Unclear or invalid session → user mapping

Current State: Logs now show a unique user ID and actual email, indicating you are operating as your real Google-authenticated user.

5. Ongoing Risks and Checks
If you log out and log in with a different user, make sure everything resets and data does not leak between users.

If tokens expire, you want to confirm your refresh workflow actually renews them (otherwise, silent calendar sync failures can creep in).

Try in an incognito/private window to ensure no stale cookies/sessions are masking latent bugs.

What Needs to Be Fixed or Verified Now?
Test a Complete Login/Logout Cycle:

Log out, restart browser, log back in. Events should only show for the correct user.

Check Session/Cookie Handling:

Open dev tools and look for cookies; you should see a session cookie (like connect.sid). Delete it, reload the app, confirm you get logged out.

Test Google Calendar Permissions:

Try revoking OAuth from your Google Account's permissions page, then re-login. The OAuth flow should detect loss of tokens and prompt you to sign in again.

Frontend Calls with Credentials:

All fetch/API calls in the browser need { credentials: "include" } so that cookies flow to the backend, maintaining the session.

Database Sanity:

Scan your database for duplicates, test users, or inconsistent records (especially with earlier fallback/default user logic).

Edge Cases for Force-Fix/Recovery:

Make sure that running any manual or UI-based "force session recovery" functionality does NOT irreversibly break real OAuth-authenticated users for that session.
