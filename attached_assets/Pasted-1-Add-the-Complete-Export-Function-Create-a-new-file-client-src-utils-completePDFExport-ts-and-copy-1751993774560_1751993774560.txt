1. Add the Complete Export Function
Create a new file client/src/utils/completePDFExport.ts and copy the first artifact I created. This will handle all the data extraction properly.
2. Replace Your Export Handler
In your client/src/pages/planner.tsx file, replace the handleExportAction function with the one from the second artifact.
3. Update Your Export Component
Replace your ExportToPDF component with the third artifact to get debugging options.
4. Test the Fix

First, use the Debug Export: Click "üîç Test Export (Debug)" - this will:

Log ALL your event data to the browser console
Download a test text file
Show you exactly what data is being captured


Check the Console: Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and look at the console output when you click the test export. You should see:
=== EXPORT DATA TEST ===
Input events: [number]
Selected date: [date]
Generated data: [object with all your appointments]

Verify the Text Export: The downloaded text file should show ALL your appointments like:
DAILY PLANNER
Monday, July 8, 2025
==================================================

Total Appointments: 11

APPOINTMENTS:
--------------------------------------------------
1. 08:00-09:00
   Dan re: Supervision
   Source: Google Calendar | Duration: 1hr

2. 09:00-10:00
   Sherrita Hossein Appointment
   Source: Google Calendar | Duration: 1hr

[... and so on for all 11 appointments]


5. Common Issues to Check
If you're still not getting all appointments:

Calendar Filters: Check that all your calendars are selected in the sidebar
Date Range: Make sure you're exporting the right date
Event Loading: Try the "Refresh Events" button first

6. Debug Commands
Add these to your browser console to debug:
javascript// Check current events
console.log('Current events:', window.currentEvents);

// Check selected calendars  
console.log('Selected calendars:', window.selectedCalendars);

// Check date
console.log('Selected date:', window.selectedDate);
The new export system will capture ALL your appointment data properly instead of just the partial data you were getting before. The debug export will show you exactly what's happening so we can fix any remaining issues!
Try the "üîç Test Export (Debug)" button first and let me know what you see in the console and downloaded file.
