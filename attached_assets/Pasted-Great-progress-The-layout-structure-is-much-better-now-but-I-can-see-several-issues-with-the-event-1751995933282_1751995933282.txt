Great progress! The layout structure is much better now, but I can see several issues with the event rendering:

1. **Events are compressed to the right side** instead of spanning the full column width
2. **Missing event styling** (borders, backgrounds)
3. **Event content format** doesn't match the target layout
4. **Event positioning** seems off

Here are the specific fixes needed:## 🔧 **Quick Implementation Steps**

### 1. **Replace the event rendering functions** in `htmlTemplatePDF.ts` with the corrected versions above

### 2. **Add debugging to see what's happening** with your events:

```typescript
// Add this to your handleExportAction function BEFORE calling exportHTMLTemplatePDF:
console.log('=== EVENT DEBUG ===');
dayEvents.forEach(event => {
  console.log({
    title: event.title,
    source: event.source,
    calendarId: event.calendarId,
    startTime: event.startTime.toLocaleString()
  });
});
```

### 3. **Check your event source detection**

Looking at your current output, it seems like events aren't getting the proper styling. This suggests the event type detection might be wrong. Make sure your events have the correct `source` and `calendarId` properties.

**For SimplePractice events** (should have blue left border):
- `event.source === 'simplepractice'` OR
- `event.title.includes('Appointment')` OR  
- `event.calendarId === '0np7sib5u30o7oc297j5pb259g'`

**For Google Calendar events** (should have dashed green border):
- `event.source === 'google'` AND not SimplePractice

## 🎯 **Expected Changes After Fix**

1. **Events will span full column width** instead of being compressed
2. **SimplePractice events** will show **thick blue left border**
3. **Google Calendar events** will show **dashed green border all around**
4. **Each event** will show **3 lines**:
   - **Event Title** (bold, larger)
   - **SOURCE NAME** (smaller, gray, all caps)
   - **HH:MM-HH:MM** (bold time range)

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

1. **Implement the fixes** above
2. **Export a daily view** 
3. **Check the browser console** for the debug output
4. **Verify event styling**:
   - Do SimplePractice appointments have blue left borders?
   - Do Google Calendar events have dashed green borders?
   - Does each event show title + source + time?

## 🔍 **If Events Still Look Wrong**

Add this temporary debugging to your event data:

```typescript
// In planner.tsx, in handleExportAction function:
console.log('Current events for export:', currentEvents.map(e => ({
  title: e.title,
  source: e.source,
  calendarId: e.calendarId,
  hasAppointmentInTitle: e.title.toLowerCase().includes('appointment')
})));
```

This will show us exactly what data is being passed to the PDF generator, so we can fix the event type detection if needed.

Try implementing these fixes and let me know what the console output shows - that will help us pinpoint exactly what's happening with the event rendering!
