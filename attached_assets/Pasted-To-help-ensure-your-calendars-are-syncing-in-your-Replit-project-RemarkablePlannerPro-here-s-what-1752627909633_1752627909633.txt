To help ensure your calendars are syncing in your Replit project (RemarkablePlannerPro), here’s what you should typically provide and check for the AI or integration system to work correctly:

**1. Google Calendar API Credentials:**
- You need to provide valid Google API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) via environment variables or a configuration file.
- The OAuth2 client must be set up for the correct redirect URIs (matching your deployment, e.g., https://howremarkable.replit.app/auth/google).

**2. OAuth Tokens:**
- The user (you) must authenticate with Google and authorize calendar access.
- Your app must securely store and refresh access and refresh tokens.

**3. User Email Association:**
- The authenticated user (Google account email) should be linked to any internal user/session system in your app, so the correct calendar is synced for the right user.

**4. Calendar Permissions:**
- Make sure your OAuth consent screen and API scope are set for at least `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.
- If not, you won’t be able to read/write events.

**5. Error Handling and Feedback:**
- The app should clearly log or display:
  - If the user is authenticated.
  - If token refresh fails.
  - If any API call to Google Calendar fails, with the relevant error message.

**What you can provide/input:**
- When prompted in the UI, click to connect your Google account and authorize access.
- If manually configuring, provide:
  - The Google Client ID/Secret.
  - Any tokens or codes requested during OAuth setup.
  - The Google account you want to sync with.
- Review environment variables/settings in Replit to ensure they match the expected naming in your app (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, etc.).
- If there’s a UI for “Connect calendar” or “Sync with Google,” use it and follow all prompts to completion.

**What the AI or app needs to see for successful sync:**
- “Authenticated” status for your account.
- “Tokens valid” confirmation in logs.
- No errors from Google Calendar API calls.

**Debug/checklist if syncing fails:**
- Re-authorize Google access (use the “Sign in with Google” or connect button again).
- Check logs for error states like “invalid_grant,” “token expired,” or “insufficient permissions.”
- Verify you’re logged in as the right Google user.

**Where to check in your current app:**
- From your current page, look for logs or indicators like:
  - “Session user authenticated: jonathan.procter@gmail.com”
  - “hasValidTokens: true”
- If these are present and no Google API errors are in the logs, syncing should work.

If you want more specific troubleshooting, let me know what error or status message you see when you try to sync—or if there’s a UI flow you’re unsure about!
