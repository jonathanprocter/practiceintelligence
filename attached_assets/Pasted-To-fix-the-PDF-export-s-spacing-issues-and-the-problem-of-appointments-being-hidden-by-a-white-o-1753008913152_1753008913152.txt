To fix the PDF export's **spacing issues** and the problem of appointments being hidden by a white overlay at the bottom, here’s what you should clearly instruct Replit's AI agent (or other AI coding copilots) to do:

**1. Diagnose Structure & CSS/Layout Issues:**  
Ask the AI to review the code responsible for the daily PDF export—especially the components that generate the day’s appointments and the overall container (usually a React component or template plus styling files). Here’s what to specify:
- Check if the content inside the PDF is within fixed-height containers or those with restricted overflow that might clip content or cause overlays.
- Look for any div or CSS with `overflow: hidden` or `position: absolute/fixed` at the bottom of the export page—this can create unwanted overlays.
- Inspect if margins or paddings are set so large that they push appointments below the viewable/exported area.

**2. Address the White Overlay:**  
- Search the code for anything that renders a white background or overlay (e.g., a footer bar or fixed element at the bottom for a watermark or UI decoration).
- Suggest to the AI: “Remove or make transparent the bottom overlay, or ensure it is layered below (using z-index/layering or by changing its export logic).”

**3. Dynamic Height/Spacing:**  
- Request the AI to ensure that the appointments section has dynamic height/expansion so all appointments render in the PDF, regardless of quantity.
- Ask to “Implement page breaking in the PDF export if the appointments list is long, or allow the export container to grow in height automatically.”

**4. General Spacing:**  
- Recommend revising padding, margin, and font sizes so that elements don’t crowd each other, especially as the PDF format may shift these compared to the web view.
- Suggest: “Add extra bottom padding/margin to prevent the last appointment from being cut off by page footers or overlays.”

**Example Prompt for Replit’s AI:**
> “In the PDF export code for the daily calendar, check if the container for appointments or the overall content restricts height or uses overflow: hidden. Remove or adjust any bottom-fixed white overlays or backgrounds so they do not cover appointments. Ensure all content appears, even when there are many appointments, by allowing sections to expand. Add extra space at the bottom of the page to prevent content from being clipped.”

**Extra Tips:**
- If using a library like `react-pdf`, remind the AI to review how pages and overflowing sections are handled—there are often props/settings to allow page breaks or control height.
- Encourage incremental change: If possible, provide the specific file(s) or code you suspect, and invite the AI to review or generate improvements one at a time so you can test after each change[1].

**Summary:**
- Review and fix container height/overflow, adjust or remove overlay/footer, allow for dynamic content height, revise margin/padding, and use page breaking if available in the PDF export tool. This approach resolves most clipping/overlay issues in PDF exports—especially in React or web-based tools like Replit[1].

You can copy the above as clear instructions to Replit’s AI for your project, or paste the relevant export code to get more surgical fixes.
