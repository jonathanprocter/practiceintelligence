Here’s what you should tell Replit—or any dev/AI assistant—**when the output is continually wrong, despite your detailed requirements and their iterative fixes**. This guidance will increase their odds of truly solving your problem instead of just patching obvious bugs.

## Guidance & Insight to Provide Replit When Output Remains Incorrect

**1. Escalate Beyond Quick Fixes—Ask For “Root Cause Analysis”**  
> "The output is still visually wrong after multiple attempts and partial fixes. Please stop making only surface-level adjustments and instead do a real root cause analysis.  
>  
> I need you to step back, systematically review the full style/data flow, and identify why the extracted measurements and intended CSS variables are NOT actually making it into the PDF output—even with logging and fallbacks."

**2. Demand “Debug-by-Comparison” With Live Dashboard**  
> "You must not rely on assumptions about what should work. Take a screenshot of my actual dashboard and of the PDF export, and perform a grid-by-grid, text-by-text comparison. For each visual difference, write a short debug note:  
> - Which variable/source is used in the dashboard?  
> - What value is being used in the PDF generation?  
> - Where, in the code, is the value lost or overridden?"  
>
> "Post a table/log for up to five key visual elements (e.g., slot height, column width, font size, cell padding, border radius) showing:  
> | Element           | Dashboard Value | PDF Value | Source/Reason for Mismatch |  
> |-------------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------------|  
> | Day column width  | 110px          | 18px      | Wrong DOM node used       |  
> | Slot height       | 40px           | 24px      | Hardcoded default         |  
> | Font family       | Inter          | Helvetica | jsPDF font limit          |  
> | …                 |                |           |                           |"

**3. Isolate Each Transformation Step**  
> "Break down the pipeline:  
> - DOM extraction → Data transfer → PDF function call → Rendered PDF  
> For each UI dimension, log the value at every step. Where does it go wrong—DOM? Prop? PDF arg?  
> Expose ALL intermediate values—don't just console.log in one spot."

**4. If jsPDF Is the Bottleneck, Try an Alternate Export Stack**  
> "If `jsPDF` cannot produce a perfect replica due to font, color, or positioning limitations, please prototype an export using:  
> - **Puppeteer or Playwright:** Headless Chrome print-to-PDF guarantees a real, pixel-for-pixel export  
> - **React-pdf:** If using React, mirror your layout with react-pdf’s canvas/DOM system  
> If this new approach works, document why jsPDF can’t get all the way there and switch the pipeline permanently."

**5. Implement & Log a “100% Style Variable Pass-through”**  
> "Audit every `setFont`, `rect`, `setFillColor`, every PDF command in the export source.  
>  
> For each, note:  
> - Is it using a prop or value sourced from the real dashboard style/theme?  
> - Or, is it defaulting to a magic number or approximation?  
> I want an audit log showing every style value in the PDF and where it comes from."

**6. Deliver “Failing Case Minimal Repro”**  
> "Produce the smallest possible calendar example (e.g., just 2 slots, 1 row, 1 event)—with the dashboard and PDF side-by-side—and show the precise place where the rendered output diverges.  
>  
> This helps diagnose whether the bug is in measurement extraction, style loss, PDF rendering, or data translation."

**7. Suggest Automated Pixel Comparison for Final Sign-Off**  
> "Automate a pixel-diff comparison using [Pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch). Refuse to claim a fix until the pixel diff is zero, excluding the actual cell text content."

## Copy-Paste Checklist for Your Ticket

```markdown
**The output continues to be wrong. Please follow this escalation workflow:**

1. Do a root cause analysis; don’t just patch symptoms.
2. For each key calendar visual element (column, row, cell, font, line), log dashboard value, PDF value, and the source or mismatch reason.
3. Instrument your code to pass measurements through every transformation step, and log/verify at each stage.
4. If jsPDF is the blocking factor, perform a print-to-PDF from headless Chrome, document results, and recommend the switch if quality dramatically improves.
5. Audit every PDF rendering command—show the source for every dimension/color/font used (should be *only* dashboard-derived values).
6. Provide and fix a minimal failing example (one event, one row/col, max clarity).
7. Automate and attach a pixel-diff test verifying zero visual difference before closing this as “fixed”.

Without these steps, further tweaks are unlikely to result in true pixel-perfect output.
```

## Summary

**Instruct Replit to debug systematically** and not just reactively. Demand logs/tables comparing dashboard and PDF, full style-path auditing, and, if needed, a prototype using print-to-PDF from a real browser. Stop after each “fix” to verify the root cause is truly addressed, and require a pixel-diff result for true final sign-off.
