Your current implementation has the basic structure but needs the appointments and proper time grid. Here's what you need to copy and paste into Replit:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Copy This Complete Code to Replit:**

The code I provided above will transform your current basic daily planner into the full-featured version you need. Here's what it will do:

### âœ… **Immediate Fixes:**
1. **Extends time grid** from just "06:00" to full "06:00-23:00" range
2. **Adds all 11 Monday appointments** in correct positions
3. **Positions Event Notes/Action Items at TOP** of appointments (Dan & Sherrifa)
4. **Prevents overlap** between appointments
5. **Styles navigation buttons** properly

4. **Your daily planner will transform** to show all appointments

### ðŸ”§ **What You'll See After Running:**

- **Full time grid** from 6 AM to 11 PM
- **All 11 appointments** positioned correctly:
  - Dan (8-9 AM) with notes at top

  - Nancy (10-11 AM) - no overlap!
  - All other appointments through Steven (8-9 PM)
- **Proper button styling** for navigation
- **Hover effects** on appointments

### ðŸŽ¨ **For Other Days:**
Modify the `appointmentsData` array in the code with each day's specific appointments. The framework is set up to handle any day.
